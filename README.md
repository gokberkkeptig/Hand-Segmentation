# Hand-Segmentation

# Objectives 
  A typical Automatic Sign Language Recognition System (ASLRS) requires the 
implementation of a complete processing chain encompassing hand segmentation, feature encoding 
and the recognition steps. The main objective of this project is to implement the first stage of 
ASLRS.
